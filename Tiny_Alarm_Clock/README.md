## **Welcome to this Tiny clock!! <br />**

This application is made using python and tkinter and uses bare minimum functionality.  <br />
Since there wasn't a good clock made using tkinter so I tried make one and also you can add more features to this. <em>(if you know how to use tkinter)</em>  <br />

 Requirements-> <br />
<li>Look at the import line of main.py and install the necessary stuff. </li> 
<li>I made it on GNU/Linux so I didn't use winsound which is available for windows natively. </li>
<li>On GNU/Linux you may need sudo to run the program. (don't worry there isn't any malware lol it's just required for keyboard)</li>
<li>To understand how the clock works I have added comments in the code also you can visit the the below link to understand the basics and then try understanding my code.</li>
</ul>
